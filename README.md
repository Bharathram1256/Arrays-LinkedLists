Graded Assignment on Arrays and Linked Lists 

Question 1: Cumulative Multiple of an Array with exception handling

Skill Mapping: Basic

Description: Consider an Array with N number of integers.

Task 1- WAP in Java to calculate cumulative multiple at each index.

Task 2 â€“ Push the result into the same Array and Print.

Task 3 - Handle the exceptions in program

Sample input: arrNum = [5, 3, 4, 2, 0, 8]

Output:- arrNum = [5, 15, 60, 120, 0, 0]

Explanation:- arrNum[0] -> C.M. = 5

arrNum[1] -> C.M. = 5 x 3

arrNum[2] -> C.M. = 5 x 3 x 4

arrNum[3] -> C.M. = 5 x 3 x 4 x 2

arrNum[4] -> C.M. = 5 x 3 x 4 x 2 x 0

arrNum[5] -> C.M. = 5 x 3 x 4 x 2 x 0 x 8

Question 2: Find missing numbers in array -

Skill Mapping: Basic

Description: Consider an array with N number of consecutive integers, in which few numbers are missing. Find and list down these missing numbers using Java.

Sample input: arrNum = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}

Output: 3

Sample input: arrNum = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14}

Output: 4, 7, 9, 12, 13

Question 3: Find the count of singulars in array -

Skill Mapping: Expert

Description: Consider data with assorted details of socks pair IDs. Each element in the array represents a number of similar pairs. You will have to find out how many singular socks are present which do not have any pair left.

Sample input: arrNum = {10, 20, 20, 10, 10, 30, 50, 10, 20}

Output: Count of singular socks = 3

Explanation : Socks Id - 10: total count 4 => Two pairs of socks - no singular left

Socks Id - 20: total count 3 => One pair of socks - 1 singular left

Socks Id - 30: total count 1 => No pair of socks - 1 singular left

Socks Id - 50: total count 1 => No pair of socks - 1 singular left

So, Total number of Singular socks = 3

Question 5: Merge and Sort the elements in two Linked-List

Skill Mapping: Intermediate

Description: Consider two Linked-List with N number of integers in Data-Node respectively.

Task 1- WAP in Java to merge both Linked-Lists.

Task 2 - Sort the output Linked-List basis of its Data-Node in ascending order.

Sample input: Linked-List-1:- 25->35->12->4->36->48

Linked-List-2:- 8->32->22->45->63->49

Output:- 4->8->12->22->25->32->35->36->45->48->49->63

Question 6: Remove Duplicates from Linked-List

Skill Mapping: Intermediate

Description: Consider a Linked-List with N number of repeated integers in Data-Node.

Task - WAP in Java to remove the repeated integer numbers from Linked-List.

Sample input: Linked-List:- 2->5->12->2->3->5->1->2->5->5

Output:- 2->5->12->3->1
